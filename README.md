# Handling-Bigdata-using-NoSQL
With the emergence of Big Data, the use of NoSQL (Not only SQL) technology is rising  rapidly among internet companies and other enterprises. Benefits include simplicity of design,  horizontal scaling and finer control over availability. NoSQL databases are increasingly  considered a viable alternative to relational databases, as more organizations recognize that its  schema less data model is a better method for handling the large volumes of structured, semi  structured and unstructured data, being captured and processed today. For example NoSQL  databases are often used to collect and store social media data. This project aims to introduce the  concepts behind NoSQL, provides a review of relevant literature, highlights the different NoSQL  database types, and provide arguments for and against adopting NoSQL. A small prototype  application has been developed to assess the stated NoSQL benefits and illustrate the differences  between the SQL and NoSQL approaches. The last section of the paper offers some conclusions  and recommendations for further research to expand upon our research work.
